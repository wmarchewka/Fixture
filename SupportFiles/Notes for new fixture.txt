WHY?
Get with Pual about calibration exactly how it works
Why does the incoming signal have to be so precise?  Is it because we take a long time to sample?
Can we send the incoming signals out through the trace line of the teridian?
Can we just simulate a 60hz low amperage signal?
Can we inject a ma signal?

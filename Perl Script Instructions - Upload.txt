Perl Script Instructions for CPM File Upload
============================================

1.) Install Perl on your computer.

    Note, the scripts were tested with Active Perl and
    Strawberry Perl.

    http://strawberryperl.com/

2.) Copy the following files to your Downloads folder:

      Cmd Pmt
      mupload.pl
      unit_upload.pl
      upload_list.txt
      firmware_v3.36.bin
      web_pages_UEC025_ENG.tfs

3.) Double click on the file "upload_list.txt" to open it.
    This file specifies each meter to update by IP Address,
    Username, and Password.  Replace the example list
    with your list.  The last line of the list must
    have a Carrage Return after it like all of the
    preceeding lines; otherwise, the last line will
    not be processed.

4.) Double click on "Cmd Pmt" to open the
    Command Prompt window.

5.) Copy the following text:

      perl mupload.pl upload_list.txt image firmware_v3.36.bin

    Right Click on the Command Prompt window and select "Paste"
    from the pop-up menu.  Then press "Enter" on the keyboard.

    Wait for the script to process all of the IP Addresses in
    the list.

    Note, if you have a newer version of firmware, change the
    version number before you copy the text.

6.) Repeat the previous step for the other files you want
    to update:

      perl mupload.pl upload_list.txt web web_pages_UEC025_ENG.tfs
      perl mupload.pl upload_list.txt meter meter_v1.20.hex
      perl mupload.pl upload_list.txt certs certificates.tfs
      perl mupload.pl upload_list.txt wifi wifi_v0x2124a503.bin
